- Direction Finder Swift Code.
- iOS App coded in XCode.
- Uses location and device orientation to determine the direction and distance to saved locations ('waypoints') and display it intuitively as if by a set of compass needles.
- Useful for maps-free navigation, which requires less network load on behalf of the technology and can be more enjoyable on behalf of the user. By displaying the path to take via direction and distance in an intuitive format, rather than a sequence of turns to take, the user can enjoy a more adventurous journey. Alternatively, the app can be used to simply provide spatial geographic information, such as whether or not you are physically closer to one friend's home or another's, or in which direction a family member away at university might be.
